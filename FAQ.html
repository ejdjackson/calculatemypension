                  How does the calculator work?
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  There are three stages to the calculation:
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>1. Accumulate Funds To Retirement: </strong>Your funds are accumulated along your planned regular contributions and fund growth up to your chosen retirement date.
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>2. Calculate Maximum Affordable Retirment Income: </strong>Payments from your funds in retirement are then simulated multiple times, adjusting the values each time in order to target a final fund of zero.
                  The payment that hits this target is your maximum affordable retirement income. If this is less than your desired retirement income, the shortfall is calculated.
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>3. Optimise Drawdown Plan for Tax Efficiency: </strong>If you have ISA funds to draw from, the split of payments between pension and ISA is then calculated each year to minimise tax due.

                  <p>If you are already retired, the calculator can assist in managing the drawdown of your funds. The calculator provides an updated overview of how your finances are performing, helping you monitor the sustainability of your savings and income over time.

                        <p style="padding: 0 30px;">- To age 68: Those born after April 1977 are currently expected to have a state pension age of 68, although the timing of this change could vary based on government review​.</p>

                  </div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A defined benefit (DB) pension is a type of pension plan that provides a guaranteed income in retirement, usually based on a formula involving factors like your salary and length of service with your employer. Unlike defined contribution pensions, which depend on investment returns, a DB pension provides a predictable retirement income, typically paid for life.</p>

                  </div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>In a DB pension, your retirement income is usually calculated based on your "final salary" (or career average in some schemes) and the number of years you've worked for your employer. For example, a common formula might be a percentage of your final salary for each year of service. This means the more years you work and the higher your salary, the more your pension income will be.</p>

                    Does my defined benefit pension have a fund?
                  </div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Generally, defined benefit pensions don’t have individual funds for each member. Instead, there is a central fund managed by the scheme to meet the future pension payments of all members. However, if you leave the scheme, you may have the option to transfer your benefits to a different pension scheme, which would involve calculating a "transfer value" of your accrued benefits.</p>

                  </div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, many defined benefit pension schemes allow you to take a portion of your pension as a tax-free lump sum when you start receiving your benefits. This may reduce the amount of regular income you receive, as it’s generally exchanged for a smaller pension, but it allows for a one-time, tax-free payment.</p>

                  </div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The age at which you can start receiving your defined benefit pension is usually set by your scheme’s normal retirement age, often between 60 and 65. Some schemes allow you to take benefits earlier, but this might result in a reduced pension due to early payment. Always check with your scheme to understand your options.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                      The results of the model are based on deterministic economic assumptions for fund growth and inflation.
                      It is assumed that these are fixed and do not vary from a single value over time.
                      In reality they will fluctuate up and down.

                      The calculator projects values forward based on your age, starting with a full year. It therefore assumes that today is your birthday!
                      <br><br>Increases to the state pension occur on April 6th, but the calculator applies the increases at the end of each projection year. Therefore the calculator also assumes your birthday is April 6th.

                    How does the mix of income affect tax I will need to pay in retirement?
                  </div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Tax is due on pensions but not ISAs. To minimise tax paid on pensions in the early years of retirement, it is worth using up all tax-free allowances available to you each year. The rest of your income can then consist of ISA withdrawals, if you still have the ISA funds available. The calculator automatically takes this into account when splitting your income in retirement.</p>

                    What about state pension and any defined benefit pensions I have?
                  </div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The calculator works out how much State Pension you are due and when it will start to be paid. You can enter the details of a defined benefit pension, and the calculator will add this to the retirement income mix at the appropriate age. Once these kick in, it is likely that your income will exceed your tax-free allowances, so any additional desired income will initially be taken from your ISAs as this will minimise tax due.</p>

                    How is tax on my pension income calculated?
                  </div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The calculator determines the tax on your pension income by first applying your personal allowance — the amount you can earn each year without paying tax. It then assesses your total pension income, including the State Pension and any other pensions, and applies the appropriate tax bands (basic, higher, and additional rates) based on your taxable income. 
                      <br><br>If you choose to take a <strong>Tax Free Cash (TFC)</strong> lump sum, up to <strong>25%</strong> of your pension can be withdrawn tax-free. The calculator also accounts for any remaining TFC percentage not utilised - it works like an extra tax free allowance percentage on all future income taken from your pension. 
                      <br><br>Additionally, if you select <strong>Scottish tax rates</strong>, the calculator uses the specific Scottish tax bands to accurately calculate your tax liability. </p>
