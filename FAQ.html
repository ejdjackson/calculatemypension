                        <p>The amount of state pension you will receive depends on your National Insurance record. </p>
                        <p>As of the 2024/25 tax year, the full State Pension is £11,500 per year. </p>  
                        <p>To qualify for the full amount, you need 35 years of National Insurance contributions or credits. </p>

                      At what age do I receive my state pension?

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The age at which you receive your State Pension depends on your date of birth and is gradually increasing due to changes in government policy. As of 2024:</p>
                        <p style="padding: 0 30px;">- If you were born between 6 April 1960 and 5 March 1961, your State Pension age is 66.</p> 
                        <p style="padding: 0 30px;">- If you were born after 5 March 1961 but before 6 April 1977, your State Pension age is 67.</p> 
                        <p style="padding: 0 30px;">- For those born on or after 6 April 1977, the State Pension age is expected to rise to 68.</p>  
                          
                        <p>The calculator approximates your birthday based on the current age input and then uses these rules.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The state pension has a triple-lock which increases the amount each year by whichever is the highest: prices, earnings or 2.5%</p>
                        <p>The calculator uses a single assumption for future inflation, the initial default value being 2%.</p>
                        <p>You can change the assumption for future inflation used by the calculator. </p>
                        <p>The projected increases are calculated to be the higher of this value and 2.5%</p>

                <!-- FAQ 1 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                  <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">

                    How does the calculator decide when to take income from an ISA?
                  </div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The calculator prioritises using your pension income and State Pension to meet your retirement income needs first. If these sources do not fully cover your desired monthly income, it then draws from your ISA savings to bridge the gap. Additionally, if there are still ISA funds available after covering your income needs, the calculator limits pension withdrawals to the amount that can be taken tax-free, including your personal allowance plus any remaining Tax-Free Cash (TFC) percentage not utilised. This strategy ensures that your ISA funds are used efficiently to supplement your pension while maximising tax advantages and preserving your savings for future needs or emergencies.</p>

                    How can the calculator be used if you are already retired?
                  </div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>If you are already retired, the calculator assists in managing the drawdown of your funds by allowing you to input your current age, existing retirement savings, pensions, and ISAs. You can specify your ongoing monthly withdrawals and any additional income sources, such as a defined benefit pension. The calculator provides an updated overview of how your finances are performing, helping you monitor the sustainability of your savings over time. It can indicate whether you can afford to increase your withdrawals to enhance your lifestyle or if you need to reduce them to ensure your funds last throughout your retirement. This tool enables you to make informed decisions about your financial strategy, ensuring your retirement remains secure and aligned with your financial goals.</p>

                    How is tax on my pension income calculated?
                  </div>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The calculator determines the tax on your pension income by first applying your <strong>personal allowance</strong>—the amount you can earn each year without paying tax. It then assesses your total pension income, including the State Pension and any other pensions, and applies the appropriate <strong>tax bands</strong> (basic, higher, and additional rates) based on your taxable income. If you choose to take a <strong>Tax Free Cash (TFC)</strong> lump sum, up to <strong>25%</strong> of your pension can be withdrawn tax-free. The calculator also accounts for any remaining TFC percentage not utilised. Additionally, if you select <strong>Scottish tax rates</strong>, the calculator uses the specific Scottish tax bands to accurately calculate your tax liability. This ensures that your pension income is taxed correctly, helping you understand your net retirement income and plan accordingly.</p>
